# Euler-Project

this project's only for fun to practice some math while I am bored, probably nothing interesting will be there. Most of the codes will be written in C++. If you find this interesting and follow along, star the project, feel free to suggest improvements.

Here is a link to the website:

I will make sure to mention problem number on my solutions
